Arc Governance Alignment
Overview

LazosTech DAO models university assemblies as modular on-chain governance sessions.

The architecture follows Arc’s vision of programmable coordination and collective decision-making.

Each assembly session behaves as a DAO lifecycle:

Assembly initialization

Proposal creation

Voting window

Result consolidation

Immutable on-chain record

This mirrors real-world governance workflows using blockchain primitives.

DAO Sessions as Coordination Units

The project introduces a new governance context: offline-first assemblies.

Instead of token communities, the DAO represents:

University boards

Student assemblies

Institutional decision committees

Each assembly becomes a temporary DAO instance.

Modular Diamond Architecture

The smart contracts use a Diamond Standard architecture, enabling modular governance upgrades.

Key governance facets:

DaoFacet.sol → proposal lifecycle

ParticipationFacet.sol → voting logic

UniversityFacet.sol → institutional roles

MarketplaceFacet.sol → future incentive layer

This modular design aligns with Arc’s mission of flexible governance infrastructure.

Real-World Impact

Arc enables coordination of online communities.
LazosTech extends this coordination model into physical institutions.

This demonstrates how DAO infrastructure can power governance beyond crypto-native environments.
