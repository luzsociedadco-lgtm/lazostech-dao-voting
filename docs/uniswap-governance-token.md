Token-Based Governance (Uniswap-Inspired)
Overview

LazosTech DAO uses an ERC-20 compatible token model to represent voting power in university assemblies.

The design is inspired by Uniswap governance primitives, where tokens enable:

Transparent voting power distribution

Auditable vote counting

Replayable governance sessions

Why Tokenized Voting

Traditional assemblies rely on:

Hand counts

Paper ballots

Manual minutes

This creates:

Low transparency

No audit trail

High coordination cost

Tokenized voting solves this by making every vote verifiable and immutable.

Governance Token Role

The governance token represents:

Board membership

Student representation

Assembly participation rights

Future expansions may include:

Incentives for participation

Delegated voting

Quadratic voting experiments

Alignment with Uniswap Mission

Uniswap pioneered large-scale token governance.
This project applies the same principles to educational and civic governance.

It demonstrates how DeFi governance primitives can power real-world institutions.
